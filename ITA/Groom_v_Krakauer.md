# Comparison of Jon Krakauer’s *Into Thin Air* and Michael Groom’s *Sheer Will*

The comparison between Jon Krakauer’s *Into Thin Air* and Michael Groom’s *Sheer Will* reveals significant discrepancies in their accounts of the events that occurred on May 10, 1996, particularly during the four-hour period from 3:30 PM to 7:30 PM. Below is a detailed comparison and analysis:

---

## 1. South Summit to Below the Balcony

### Krakauer's Account (*Into Thin Air*, 1997):
- Claims he left the South Summit at 3:30 PM ahead of Groom and Namba, descending alone into worsening weather.
- Describes pausing to wait for Namba, who was struggling with fixed ropes, then asking Groom for permission to continue down alone, which Groom allegedly granted.
- Portrays himself as separated from Groom and Namba by approximately 4 PM.

### Groom's Account (*Sheer Will*, 1997):
- Describes descending with both Namba and Krakauer from the South Summit, with all three moving together below the Balcony.
- Explicitly states that Krakauer and Namba were descending together while he stopped to assist Martin Adams, a disoriented climber from Fischer's group.
- No mention of Krakauer leaving the group at 3:30 PM or of any separation by 4 PM.

## 2. Encounter with Martin Adams

### Krakauer's Account:
- In *Into Thin Air*, Krakauer separates himself from Groom and Namba before Adams' tumble. He recounts Groom handling Adams while he was already below the Balcony.
- In the 1999 postscript, Krakauer quotes Groom’s account from *Sheer Will*, where all three (Krakauer, Namba, and Groom) encounter Adams together above the Balcony.

### Groom's Account:
- Groom describes descending with Namba and Krakauer when they encounter Adams, who was tumbling uncontrollably off the route.
- Groom assisted Adams back to the correct path while Krakauer and Namba continued descending.

## 3. Yasuko Namba’s Descent

### Krakauer's Account:
- Implies that Namba was left to descend alone after Groom stopped to assist Adams and allegedly searched for a camera case.
- Distances himself from Namba, claiming to have continued down alone well before the Balcony.
- Places himself safely in his tent by 7:30 PM, with no mention of Namba’s condition at that time.

### Groom's Account:
- States that he sent both Krakauer and Namba down together while he assisted Adams.
- Describes Namba as descending well, with sufficient oxygen and no signs of severe distress until later when she became separated from others in worsening conditions.

## 4. Krakauer’s Contradictions (1997 vs. 1999)
- In the 1999 postscript, Krakauer acknowledges Groom’s account as accurate, contradicting his earlier narrative in *Into Thin Air*.
- Groom’s account indicates that Krakauer and Namba were together below the Balcony, a scenario entirely absent from Krakauer’s original book.
- The omission of key details, such as Groom climbing back up to assist Rob Hall or the group’s handling of Adams, suggests deliberate editorial choices by Krakauer to avoid portraying himself as abandoning Namba.

---

## 5. Analysis of Key Discrepancies
- **Omission of Teamwork:** Krakauer’s portrayal minimizes collaborative efforts, distancing himself from Namba during critical moments. Groom’s account repeatedly emphasizes teamwork and collective decision-making.
- **Fabrication vs. Memory:** Differences between Krakauer’s 1997 and 1999 versions cannot be attributed solely to memory lapses, suggesting deliberate omissions in *Into Thin Air*.
- **Abandonment of Yasuko Namba:** Groom’s account indicates Namba was entrusted to Krakauer during the descent. Her eventual isolation and death raise questions about Krakauer’s actions and the omission of these details from his narrative.

---

## 6. Ethical and Narrative Implications
- Krakauer’s role as a journalist and storyteller is undermined by these discrepancies. His professed commitment to accuracy and honesty contrasts with the omissions and fabrications in his 1997 account.
- By quoting Groom in the postscript, Krakauer inadvertently validates a version of events that implicates him in abandoning Namba, further eroding the credibility of his earlier narrative.

---

## Conclusion
The discrepancies between *Into Thin Air* and *Sheer Will* highlight a significant divergence in the portrayal of key events on May 10, 1996. Groom’s account emphasizes teamwork, shared responsibility, and reliance on collective decision-making, while Krakauer’s narrative distances himself from these dynamics, potentially to avoid accountability for Namba’s fate. These conflicting narratives raise questions about the ethics of memoir writing, the responsibilities of climbers in extreme environments, and the impact of personal bias on historical accuracy.

## Quotes from *Into Thin Air* by Jon Krakauer

1. **On Leaving the South Summit:**
   > "Around 3:30 P.M. I left the South Summit ahead of Mike, Yasuko, and Andy, and almost immediately descended into a dense layer of clouds."  
   (*Into Thin Air*, p. 196)

2. **On Waiting for Namba:**
   > "At the bottom of the rock steps on the Southeast Ridge I stopped with Mike to wait for Yasuko, who was having difficulty negotiating the fixed ropes. He attempted to call Rob on the radio, but Mike’s transmitter was working only intermittently and he couldn’t raise anybody. With Mike looking after Yasuko, and both Rob and Andy accompanying Doug Hansen—the only other client still above us—I assumed the situation was under control. So as Yasuko caught up to us, I asked Mike’s permission to continue down alone. 'Fine,' he replied. 'Just don’t walk off any cornices.'"  
   (*Into Thin Air*, p. 197)

3. **On Meeting Beck Weathers:**
   > "About 4:45 P.M., when I reached the Balcony—the promontory at 27,600 feet on the Southeast Ridge, where I’d sat watching the sunrise with Ang Dorje—I was shocked to encounter Beck Weathers, standing alone in the snow, shivering violently."  
   (*Into Thin Air*, p. 197)

4. **On Beck Weathers’ Condition:**
   > "Beck was nearly persuaded to descend with me when I made the mistake of mentioning that Mike Groom was on his way down with Yasuko, a few minutes behind me. In a day of many mistakes, this would turn out to be one of the larger ones."  
   (*Into Thin Air*, p. 199)

5. **On Martin Adams’ Descent:**
   > "Around 5:00 P.M., as Beidleman accompanied his clients down the ridge, Mike Groom and Yasuko Namba were arriving at the Balcony some 500 feet below them. From this promontory at 27,600 feet, the route veers sharply off the ridge to the south toward Camp Four. When Groom looked in the other direction, however—down the north side of the ridge—through the billowing snow and faltering light he noticed a lone climber badly off route: it was Martin Adams, who’d become disoriented in the storm and mistakenly started to descend the Kangshung Face into Tibet."  
   (*Into Thin Air*, p. 213)

6. **On Yasuko and Groom Descending:**
   > "While Groom was waiting for Adams to climb back up to the ridge, he sent Namba down ahead and busied himself trying to find a camera case he’d left on the way up."  
   (*Into Thin Air*, p. 213)

7. **On Groom’s Assistance to Adams:**
   > "Martin was out of it by the time he got back up to Yasuko and me. His oxygen mask was off and his face was encrusted in snow. He asked, 'Which way to the tents?' Groom pointed, and Adams immediately started down the correct side of the ridge, following the trail I’d blazed perhaps ten minutes earlier."  
   (*Into Thin Air*, p. 213)

8. **On Boukreev and Teammates:**
   > "Boukreev had come down to the South Col hours in front of anyone else in Fischer’s team. Indeed, by 5:00 P.M., while his teammates were still struggling down through the clouds at 28,000 feet, Boukreev was already in his tent resting and drinking tea."  
   (*Into Thin Air*, p. 218)

9. **Final Words on Yasuko:**
   > "Beidleman paused. 'But I can’t help thinking about Yasuko,' he said when he resumed, his voice hushed. 'She was so little. I can still feel her fingers sliding across my biceps, and then letting go. I never even turned to look back.'"  
   (*Into Thin Air*, p. 302)

   (*Sheer Will*, p. 284)

2. **On Encountering Martin Adams:**
   > "Just 70 meters above the point on the South East Ridge where we had exited from the gullies that dropped into C4, the radio inside my climbing suit came to life with Rob’s voice. I let Jon and Yasuko continue while I listened intently."  
   (*Sheer Will*, p. 285)

3. **On Assisting Martin Adams:**
   > "Content that everything was under control, I caught up to Yasuko and Jon and we continued descending with one of the Americans from Fischer’s team, who was trying an unorthodox passing move in an uncontrolled tumble off to our left."
