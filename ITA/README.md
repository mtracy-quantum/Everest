In 2016, Jon Krakauer admitted that he "publicly falsified the story."

> Krakauer, however, spoke of the negative connotations of this emotional connection to a story. He used the example of *Into Thin Air*, the book he wrote after his terrible experience climbing Everest in 1996 during the Mount Everest Disaster, where eight of his companions died. Krakauer talked about a kind of anger that overcame him after the accident, which remained for some time after the book was published. He spoke of how the intensity of this anger and emotion associated with the accident was what allowed him to write the book in just three months. He went on to speak of a kind of regret he experienced after publishing the book, as his intention was to write the truth, and instead he—in his words—”publicly falsified the story.” Krakauer believes that this anger that carried through into his writing brought people to read the story in the opposite way—his fans suddenly wanted to climb Everest, when Jon was attempting to express the issues associated with the mountain as a tourist attraction.

Krakauer stated in *Into Thin Air*:

> My article in *Outside* angered several of the people I wrote about, and hurt the friends and relatives of some Everest victims. I sincerely regret this—I did not set out to harm anyone. My intent in the magazine piece, and to an even greater degree in this book, was to tell what happened on the mountain as accurately and honestly as possible, and to do it in a sensitive, respectful manner.

Taking these statements together, Krakauer's comment that he "publicly falsified the story" can be interpreted to mean that readers misinterpreted his book and reached conclusions opposite to what he intended. However, this interpretation does not align with Krakauer’s admission during the same 2016 presentation that his oxygen was stolen—a fact that does not appear anywhere in the book.

Before being aware of Krakauer's claim that his oxygen was stolen, I created a detailed video analyzing the oxygen situation at the South Summit and concluded that oxygen bottle theft occurred.

Additionally, Krakauer’s professed desire to dissuade people from climbing Everest is not supported by the facts. First, Krakauer worked for *Outside Magazine*, which profited from Everest expeditions through advertising. The deal with Rob Hall's Adventure Consultants specifically included discounts on future advertising.

Furthermore, Krakauer’s version of events attributes the deaths to the ropes not being fixed in advance, a guide not using oxygen, and the presence of a socialite on one of the expeditions. Such explanations are unlikely to dissuade anyone from attempting Everest; rather, they might simply encourage climbers to wait until all the ropes are fixed and ensure they hire a guide who uses supplemental oxygen.

Had Krakauer instead highlighted oxygen bottle theft as a major issue, it could have deterred climbers from attempting Everest, as this problem was difficult to address in 1996. Today, high-end expeditions mitigate this risk by employing dedicated Sherpas to carry bottles at all times, but this requires significantly more manpower and increases costs. In 1996, there were neither enough high-altitude porters with sufficient training to implement such measures. And there would not be for years to come.

It does not seem that readers misunderstood Krakauer’s book because he was "angry." Instead, it appears that misunderstandings about the disaster arose because Krakauer falsified the story—omitting important facts and altering others to fit the narrative he wanted to present.

The link above to the 2016 presentation is the edited online verstion.  I have reached out to the reporter to ask if she has the full recording and to verify the quotation that Krakauer "publicly falsified the story."  I have not heard back.

Krakauer has denied that he said he "publicly falsified the story."  https://jonkrakauer.medium.com/the-youtuber-on-a-mission-to-trash-my-book-chapter-six-c76201c2b9ba
