Note: Page numbers are from Kindle Edition. 

## Page 15: Mallory's Age

### Krakauer's Claim
> In 1924 Mallory was thirty-eight, a married schoolmaster with three young children.

### The Facts
Mallory was born June 18, 1886, making him 37 at the time of his death.

## Page 44: Frank Fischbeck's Everest Attempts

### Krakauer's Claim
> Frank Fischbeck, fifty-three, a dapper, genteel publisher from Hong Kong, had attempted Everest three times with one of Hall’s competitors;
> in 1994 he’d gotten all the way to the South Summit, just 330 vertical feet below the top.

### The Facts
According to **The Himalayan Database**, Fischbeck is recorded as having **four prior attempts** on Everest (not three):  
- **1992**: Attempt recorded.  
- **1993**: Attempt recorded.  
- **1994**: Highest point reached: below the South Summit.  
- **1995**: Highest point reached: Balcony.  

> Fischbeck ran out of oxygen below South Summit and turned back, so his pal Kerr (who had summited before) also turned back. Fischbeck moving fairly slowly and would have difficult to get him to summit. All slept at C4 again and on 14th to C2.
- Fischbeck's date of birth is reported as 1939, and he is reported as being 57 years old at the time of the 1996 attempt.  He was reported as 53 at the time of his first attempt in 1992.


### Discrepancy
- Krakauer's stated age for Fischbeck is significantly different from that recorded in the Himalayan Database.
- Krakauer states Fischbeck had three prior attempts on Everest.
- The Himalayan Database contradicts this, with four recorded prior attempts.
- Krakauer states that Fischbeck reached the South Summit (330 vertical feet below the summit) in 1994.
- The Himalayan Database contradicts this, recording Fischbeck’s highest point as **below the South Summit**, indicating he did not reach that landmark.

### Analysis

These errors likely arose from secondhand or misunderstood information. While the difference may appear minor, it alters the portrayal of Fischbeck’s climbing achievements, especially given the significance of reaching the South Summit.
Failure to investigate: Krakauer did not look into whether Fischbeck and been turned down by the team he had previously climbed with. Burleson and Athens were on Everest in 1996.

## Page 44: The Oldest Member

### Krakauer's Claim
> John Taske, at fifty-six the oldest member of our group, was an anesthesiologist from Brisbane who’d taken up climbing after retiring from the Australian army.

### The Facts
According to **The Himalayan Database**, Taske's birth year is recorded as 1940. 
According to Taske's CV, his birthday is May 7, 1940. (https://straskye.tripod.com/pages/documents/TaskeMilCV.pdf).  This made him 55 on March 31 -- the day in which Krakauer 
is describing the ages of the various climbers. The statement that Taske was 56 at that time is inaccurate. 

As noted above, Fischbeck is reported as the oldest member of the expedition.

## Page 47: Michael Groom's Age

### Krakauer's Claim

>When I approached, Rob Hall introduced me to Mike Groom, the expedition’s third guide. A thirty-three-year-old Australian with carrot-colored hair and the lean build of a marathon runner, Groom was a Brisbane plumber who worked as a guide only occasionally.

### The Facts
According to Himalayan Database and Groom's book, Sheer Will, Groom was born in 1959.  See Sheer Will, p.339 "If I were going to climb Makalu then I wanted to do it in the year that I turned 40 -- 1999 was that year."  Himalayan Database lists him has 36 for the 1996 climb. 

### Analysis

## Page 222-223: 1995 Summit Day Timing

### Krakauer's Claim
> On summit day that year, Hall’s team had reached the South Summit late, around 1:30 P.M., to find deep, unstable snow blanketing the final stretch of the summit ridge.

### The Facts
According to **The Himalayan Database**:
- At 8:30 a.m. at 8650m, the team started up steep rock to the South Summit and arrived there at 12:15 p.m. in chest-deep snow.
- Cotter and Lobsang Jangbu worked on fixing ropes to the Hillary Step while Hall and others waited at the South Summit, along with the Hoffman party, to assess progress.
- At 1:00 p.m., Hall’s team decided to cancel their summit bid because it was too late. The Hoffman party made the same decision.

> Hall group passed Mauduit group at C3 am at 8300m (she without oxygen, Sherpas with so as not to get cold waiting for her). Wind came up at dawn and at SE Ridge, deeper snow and very cold wind blowing snow around; reached here at 8500m at 6:30 am. All ropes below S Summit had to be dug out and some rope replaced. At 8:30 am at 8650m started up steep rock to S Summit and arrived at S Summit at 12:15 pm in chest deep snow on the rock. Cotter and Lobsang Jangbu worked in up fixing rope to Hillary Step while Hall, et al, waited at S Summit (Hoffman party too) to see Cotter progress and decided at 1 pm to cancel bid because too late (Hoffman party made same decision).


### Discrepancy
- Krakauer claims the team reached the South Summit at 1:30 p.m., but records indicate they arrived at 12:15 p.m.
- The deep snow Krakauer mentions was encountered earlier during the ascent, not just upon reaching the South Summit.
- The decision to turn back was made at 1:00 p.m., not after 1:30 p.m.

### Analysis
Krakauer’s timeline exaggerates the lateness of the South Summit arrival, misrepresenting the actual timing and conditions of Hall’s team’s progress. This inaccuracy alters the perception of the decision-making process and the challenges faced that day.

## Page 230: Timing of Summit Attempt

### Krakauer's Claim
> In the end, Boukreev—as senior guide and the only one of us who had climbed Everest previously—claimed the honor; with Beidleman paying out the rope, he did a masterful job of leading the pitch. But it was a slow process, and as he painstakingly ascended toward the crest of the Step, I nervously studied my watch and wondered whether I might run out of oxygen. My first canister had expired at 7:00 A.M. on the Balcony, after lasting about seven hours. Using this as a benchmark, at the South Summit I’d calculated that my second canister would expire around 2:00 P.M., which I’d stupidly assumed would allow plenty of time to reach the summit and return to the South Summit to retrieve my third oxygen bottle. But now it was already after 1:00, and I was beginning to have serious doubts.

### Contradictory Evidence
- On page 12 of the paperback edition, Krakauer provides a photo taken by Scott Fischer from the South Summit. The caption reads: 
  > "The summit ridge from the South Summit, May 10, 1:00 PM. When Fischer took this photo he was at the end of the line, gazing up at the crowd pushing for the top. Three climbers are visible just above the Hillary Step: a fourth can be seen in the middle of the Step."
- In the illustrated edition, page 241, Krakauer writes: 
  > "Scott Fischer, at the back of the pack, took this photo looking up from the South Summit at 1:00 PM. Three climbers—Neal Beidleman, Martin Adams, and Klev Schoening—are visible above the Hillary Step en route to the summit. Anatoli Boukreev, Jon Krakauer, and Andy Harris are out of sight above, just below the top."
- Krakauer reports being on the summit at **1:12 PM**, making it implausible for him to climb from the base of the Hillary Step after 1:00 PM and reach the summit in 12 minutes.

### Discrepancy
- The photograph evidence and detailed descriptions place Krakauer well above the Hillary Step at 1:00 PM.
- Krakauer’s claim of being near the base of the Hillary Step at 1:00 PM is contradicted by his own timeline and photographic evidence.

### Analysis
This timing error raises questions about Krakauer’s representation of events leading up to his summit attempt. It diminishes the reliability of his reported timeline and creates inconsistencies in the narrative.

## Page 236: Checking Oxygen Canisters

### Krakauer's Claim
> The only way to know how much gas is in a canister is to attach it to your regulator and read the gauge; presumably this is how Andy had checked the bottles at the South Summit.

### The Facts
- Oxygen has weight, and a full cylinder is much heavier than an empty one.
- Russian cylinders weigh **2.4 kg (5.3 lbs)** empty and hold **1.1 kg (2.4 lbs)** of oxygen, meaning a full bottle will weigh **1.1 kg (2.4 lbs)** more than an empty one.
- Attaching the regulator causes oxygen to vent until a seal is formed. This process is loud and impractical for checking multiple bottles just to determine pressure.
- Instead, climbers commonly determine if bottles are full or empty by simply picking them up to feel the weight difference.
- See: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72tgVEW3OzE 

### Discrepancy
- Krakauer’s claim that attaching a regulator is the only way to check the gas level is incorrect. The weight difference between full and empty cylinders provides an easier and more practical method.

### Analysis
This error demonstrates a misunderstanding of standard practices in high-altitude expeditions. By overlooking the practical method of weighing cylinders, Krakauer misrepresents how climbers typically check their oxygen supplies.

## Page 237 and Page 243: Oxygen Canister Usage

### Krakauer's Claim
> As Andy continued to assert that there were no full bottles at the South Summit, Mike looked at me quizzically. I looked back and shrugged. Turning to Andy, I said, "No big deal, Harold. Much ado about nothing." Then I grabbed a new oxygen canister, screwed it onto my regulator, and headed down the mountain.

### Contradictory Statement
>Three hours earlier, when I’d attached my regulator to my third and last oxygen canister, I’d noticed that the gauge indicated that the bottle was only half full.
> Krakauer, Jon. *Into Thin Air* (p. 243).

### Discrepancy
- On Page 237, Krakauer describes grabbing a "new oxygen canister" to replace his depleted supply.
- On Page 243, Krakauer acknowledges that his "third and last oxygen canister" was already half empty when he attached it.

### Analysis
This inconsistency undermines the reliability of Krakauer's account. It raises questions about the availability of oxygen at critical moments and whether the actions described align with the physical resources present during the expedition.

## Page 269: Sherpa Reaching the Summit

### Krakauer's Claim
> And the other four Sherpas on our team were too cold and debilitated from having gone to the summit.

### The Facts
- The Himalayan Database records only **two Adventure Consultant Sherpa** reaching the summit.
- Krakauer also confirms elsewhere that the two-other Sherpa turned around at the South Summit.

### Discrepancy
- Krakauer’s claim that four Sherpa went to the summit is incorrect. Only two Sherpa are recorded as having reached the summit, while the other two turned back at the South Summit.

### Analysis
This overstatement inflates the number of Sherpa who summited, misrepresenting the actual events. It diminishes the specific challenges faced by the team and creates an inaccurate picture of the expedition’s dynamics.

## Page 296: Ang Dorje and Lhakpa's Climb

### Krakauer's Claim
> Both Ang Dorje and Lhakpa were cold and wasted from climbing to the summit and back just the day before.

### The Facts
- Krakauer states earlier on **Page 226** that Lhakpa did not reach the summit and instead turned around at the South Summit.
- The Himalayan Database does not record Lhakpa reaching the summit, confirming he turned back at the South Summit.

### Discrepancy
- Krakauer's claim on Page 296 contradicts his earlier statement on Page 226.
- The Himalayan Database corroborates Krakauer’s earlier statement that Lhakpa did not summit.

### Analysis

This inconsistency suggests a lack of internal coherence within the narrative. By misrepresenting Lhakpa's actions, the account overstates the exertion and accomplishment of his climb, potentially altering the reader's perception of the climbers' conditions.

## Page 302: The Ladakhis' Turnaround Point

### Krakauer's Claim
> In truth, the Ladakhis were at 28,550 feet when they turned around, about two hours below the actual summit, which at that time still jutted above the highest clouds. The fact that they unwittingly stopped some 500 feet short of their goal explains why they didn’t see Hansen, Hall, or Lopsang on top, and vice versa.  

### The Facts
From the Japenese account, the Ladakhis turned around at what is commonly referred to as the "false summit," located at approximately **28,840 feet**, not 28,550 feet.  
- The **false summit** is approximately **100 feet below the true summit**, not 500 feet as Krakauer claims.
- 28,550 is roughly the top of the Third Step "Chalie" location. 
- The estimated time from the false summit to the true summit is **20-40 minutes** for climbers in optimal conditions, **not two hours** as stated by Krakauer.

### Discrepancy
- Krakauer provides an altitude for the Ladakhis' turnaround point that is **290 feet lower** than the actual location of the false summit.  
- Krakauer overstates the time required to reach the summit from the false summit by over **1.5 hours**.  
- These inaccuracies lead to confusion about the Ladakhis’ position and their proximity to the summit.

### Analysis
Krakauer's errors in altitude and timing likely arose from secondhand or imprecise information. While the discrepancies do not fundamentally alter the narrative of the Ladakhis' decision to turn back, they significantly misrepresent their actual progress. Given the importance of precision in a high-stakes account like *Into Thin Air*, these inaccuracies detract from the reliability of Krakauer’s reporting.
