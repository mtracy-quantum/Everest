|-------|--------------------------------------|-----------------|
| **Fischbeck’s Everest Attempts (4 attempts, not 3; incorrect age given)** | *"Frank Fischbeck...had attempted Everest three times."* (p. 44) | **Not acknowledged yet.** |
| **Oldest Team Member (Taske was 55, not 56; Fischbeck was actually the oldest member)** | *"John Taske, at fifty-six, the oldest member of our group."* (p. 44) | **Not acknowledged yet.** |
| **Michael Groom’s Age (36, not 33)** | *"A thirty-three-year-old Australian... Mike Groom."* (p. 47) | **Not acknowledged yet.** |
| **Rob Hall's Summits Count (Hall was responsible for fewer than 39 summits, not "more ascents than in Everest’s first 20 years")** | *"Between 1990 and 1995, Hall was responsible for putting thirty-nine climbers on the summit of Everest—three more ascents than had been made in the first twenty years after Sir Edmund Hillary’s inaugural climb."* (p. 41) | **Not acknowledged yet.** |
| **Lou Kasiske and the 1PM Turn-Around Time (Kasiske says the 1PM turn-around was pre-set, not undecided as Krakauer claims)** | *"By midmorning on May 10, Hall still hadn’t announced what our turn-around time would actually be. Hutchison, conservative by nature, was operating on the assumption that it would be 1:00 P.M. Around 11:00,"* (p. 225) | **Not acknowledged yet.** |
| **Hillary Step Timing (Krakauer was past it before 1 PM, not at the base at 1 PM)** | *"At 1:00 P.M., I reached the base of the Hillary Step."* (p. 230) | **Acknowledged and corrected.** |
| **South Summit Descent Timing Error (Krakauer left South Summit closer to 3:50 PM, not 3:30 PM as claimed)** | *"Around 3:30 P.M. I left the South Summit ahead of Mike, Yasuko, and Andy, and almost immediately descended into a dense layer of clouds."* (p. 237) | **Not acknowledged yet.** |
| **Pittman’s Descent Timing (She left the summit before Beidleman, not with him at 3:10 PM)** | *"At 3:10 Friday afternoon Fischer still hadn’t arrived on top, says Beidleman, adding, 'I decided it was time to get the hell out of there, even though Scott hadn’t showed up yet.' He gathered up Pittman, Gammelgaard, Fox, and Madsen and started leading them down the summit ridge."* (p. 255) | **Not acknowledged yet.** |
| **Misrepresenting Oxygen Checking Method (Weight difference, not just regulator gauge)** | *"The only way to know how much gas is in a canister is to attach it to your regulator and read the gauge."* (p. 236) | **Not acknowledged yet.** |
| **Inconsistent Oxygen Usage Statements (Contradicts himself about final bottle use)** | *"I grabbed a new oxygen canister."* (p. 237) vs. *"My third and last canister was only half full."* (p. 243) | **Acknowledged and correction planned for future editions.** |
| **Sherpa Summit Count (Only 2 reached summit, not 4)** | *"And the other four Sherpas on our team were too cold and debilitated from having gone to the summit."* (p. 269) | **Not acknowledged yet.** |
| **Lhakpa's Climb (He did not summit, contradicts earlier statement)** | *"Both Ang Dorje and Lhakpa were cold and wasted from climbing to the summit and back."* (p. 296) | **Acknowledged and corrected.** |
| **Ladakhis' Turnaround (Stopped at 28,840 ft, not 28,550 ft; Krakauer overstates time to summit)** | *"The Ladakhis were at 28,550 feet when they turned around."* (p. 302) | **Not acknowledged yet.** |
| **Delays at South Summit Were Due to Rob Hall’s Orders, Not Missing Ropes** | *"The delays resulted from the combination of slow climbers and the failure to fix ropes in advance."* (p. 16) | **Not acknowledged yet.** |
| **Beidleman’s Oxygen Adjustment (He set it to 3–3.5L/min, not full flow at 4L/min)** | *"Beidleman...made sure her regulator was turned to full flow."* (p. 256-257) | **Acknowledged and corrected.** |
| **Montenegrins “Used All Their Rope” (No evidence to support claim)** | *"The Montenegrins had used all their rope on the lower sections of the climb."* (p. 221) | **Acknowledged and corrected.** |
| **Misreporting Pittman’s Descent Location (Beidleman grabbed her below South Summit, not above Hillary Step)** | *"Beidleman grabbed Pittman by her harness and started dragging her down the steep snow of the Southeast Ridge."* (p. 256-257) | **Acknowledged and corrected.** |
| **Oxygen Theft/Omission (Krakauer later admitted it, but did not mention it in the book)** | *(No mention in *Into Thin Air* of missing/stolen oxygen at South Summit.)* | **Acknowledged and correction planned for future editions.** |
| **Short-Roping Definition (Incorrectly describes it as only for weak/injured climbers)** | *"A technique for assisting a weak or injured climber known as short-roping."* (p. 213) | **Not acknowledged yet.** |
| **Oxygen Disparity Between Expeditions (Did not mention Mountain Madness planned to provide more oxygen than Adventure Consultants)** | *(No mention in *Into Thin Air* of the different oxygen provisions between teams.)* | **Acknowledged and correction planned for future editions.** |
| **Makalu Gau’s Summit Time (Gau reported 3:00 PM, but Krakauer only reports 3:45 PM without telling the reader he rejected Gau’s time)** | *"Around this time two Sherpas on the Taiwanese team arrived, followed soon thereafter by Makalu Gau."* (p. 282) | **Acknowledged and disputed.** |
| **Charlotte Fox’s Statement Omitted (*American Alpine Journal*) (She stated she wanted to descend, but Beidleman kept group together)** | *(Omitted from *Into Thin Air*.)* | **Not acknowledged yet.** |

| **Mallory's Age (37, not 38)** | *"In 1924 Mallory was thirty-eight, a married schoolmaster with three young children."* (p. 15) | **Acknowledged and corrected.** |

### **Why the Charlotte Fox Omission and Summit Stunt Matter**
- **Charlotte Fox stated she wanted to descend earlier, but Neal Beidleman kept the group together.**  
- This suggests **the group was told to wait at the summit longer than necessary**, possibly for a **photo or publicity event**.  
- Krakauer **acknowledges a stunt was planned** but claims **it was irrelevant**. However, **delaying descent** may have contributed to later problems on the mountain.  
- By **omitting Fox’s statement**, *Into Thin Air* makes the delay appear **natural**, when in reality, it **may have been a conscious decision that put climbers at greater risk**.
