| **Claiming they waited at South Summit for ropes to be fixed when Groom's book says it was because Rob Hall told them to wait there for his final approval.** | *"Around 11:40, Beidleman eventually asked, ‘Hey, Ang Dorje, are you going to fix the ropes, or what?’ Ang Dorje’s reply was a quick, unequivocal ‘No’—perhaps because none of Fischer’s Sherpas were there to share the work."* (p. 228). While ignoring Groom on page 278: *'" fought an internal battle, should I ignore Rob's instructions not to fix ropes and for the team to regroup at the South Summit by heading for the summit now?"* | **Not acknowledged yet.** |
| **Fischbeck’s Everest Attempts (4 attempts, not 3; incorrect age given)** | *"Frank Fischbeck...had attempted Everest three times."* (p. 44) | **Not acknowledged yet.** |
| **Oldest Team Member (Taske was 55, not 56; Fischbeck was actually the oldest member)** | *"John Taske, at fifty-six, the oldest member of our group."* (p. 44) | **Not acknowledged yet.** |
| **Michael Groom’s Info (36, not 33. Did not summit Ama Dablam at that time)** | *"A thirty-three-year-old Australian with carrot-colored hair and the lean build of a marathon runner, Groom was a Brisbane plumber who worked as a guide only occasionally. In 1987, forced to spend a night in the open while descending from the 28,169-foot summit of Kanchenjunga, he froze his feet and had to have all his toes amputated. This setback had not put a damper on his Himalayan career, however: he’d gone on to climb K2, Lhotse, Cho Oyu, Ama Dablam, and, in 1993, Everest without supplementary oxygen.."* (p. 47) | **Not acknowledged yet.** |
| **Rob Hall's Summits Count (Inaccurate in the total count and misleading as it appears to count Sherpa, his guides, himself, and the co-founder of Adventure Consultants)** | *"Between 1990 and 1995, Hall was responsible for putting thirty-nine climbers on the summit of Everest—three more ascents than had been made in the first twenty years after Sir Edmund Hillary’s inaugural climb."* (p. 41) | **Not acknowledged yet.** |
| **Lou Kasischke and the 1PM Turn-Around Time (Kasischke says the 1PM turn-around was pre-set, not undecided as Krakauer claims)** | *"By midmorning on May 10, Hall still hadn’t announced what our turn-around time would actually be. Hutchison, conservative by nature, was operating on the assumption that it would be 1:00 P.M. Around 11:00,"* (p. 225) | **Not acknowledged yet.** |
| **Hillary Step Timing (Krakauer was past it before 1 PM, not at the base at 1 PM)** | *"At 1:00 P.M., I reached the base of the Hillary Step."* (p. 230) | **Acknowledged and corrected.** |
| **South Summit Descent Timing Error (Krakauer left South Summit closer to 3:50 PM, not 3:30 PM as claimed)** | *"Around 3:30 P.M. I left the South Summit ahead of Mike, Yasuko, and Andy, and almost immediately descended into a dense layer of clouds."* (p. 237) | **Not acknowledged yet.** |
| **Pittman’s Descent Timing (She left the summit before Beidleman, not with him at 3:10 PM)** | *"At 3:10 Friday afternoon Fischer still hadn’t arrived on top, says Beidleman, adding, 'I decided it was time to get the hell out of there, even though Scott hadn’t showed up yet.' He gathered up Pittman, Gammelgaard, Fox, and Madsen and started leading them down the summit ridge."* (p. 255) | **Not acknowledged yet.** |
| **Misrepresenting Oxygen Checking Method (Weight difference, not just regulator gauge)** | *"The only way to know how much gas is in a canister is to attach it to your regulator and read the gauge."* (p. 236) | **Not acknowledged yet.** |
| **Inconsistent Oxygen Usage Statements (Contradicts himself about final bottle use)** | *"I grabbed a new oxygen canister."* (p. 237) vs. *"My third and last canister was only half full."* (p. 243) | **Acknowledged and correction planned for future editions.** |
| **Sherpa Summit Count (Only 2 reached summit, not 4)** | *"And the other four Sherpas on our team were too cold and debilitated from having gone to the summit."* (p. 269) | **Not acknowledged yet.** |
| **Lhakpa's Climb (He did not summit, contradicts earlier statement)** | *"Both Ang Dorje and Lhakpa were cold and wasted from climbing to the summit and back."* (p. 296) | **Acknowledged and corrected.** |
| **Ladakhis' Turnaround (Stopped at 28,840 ft, not 28,550 ft; Krakauer overstates time to summit)** | *"The Ladakhis were at 28,550 feet when they turned around."* (p. 302) | **Not acknowledged yet.** |
| **Delays at South Summit Were Due to Rob Hall’s Orders, Not Missing Ropes** | *"The delays resulted from the combination of slow climbers and the failure to fix ropes in advance."* (p. 16) | **Not acknowledged yet.** |
| **Beidleman’s Oxygen Adjustment (He set it to 3–3.5L/min, not full flow at 4L/min)** | *"Beidleman...made sure her regulator was turned to full flow."* (p. 256-257) | **Not acknowledged yet.** |
| **Montenegrins “Used All Their Rope” (No evidence to support claim)** | *"The Montenegrins had used all their rope on the lower sections of the climb."* (p. 221) | **Acknowledged and corrected.** |
| **Misreporting Pittman’s Descent Location (Beidleman grabbed her below South Summit, not above Hillary Step)** | *"Beidleman grabbed Pittman by her harness and started dragging her down the steep snow of the Southeast Ridge."* (p. 256-257) | **Acknowledged and corrected.** |
| **Oxygen Theft/Omission (Krakauer later admitted it, but did not mention it in the book)** | *(No mention in *Into Thin Air* of missing/stolen oxygen at South Summit.)* | **Acknowledged and correction planned for future editions.** |
| **Short-Roping Definition (Incorrectly describes it as only for weak/injured climbers)** | *"A technique for assisting a weak or injured climber known as short-roping."* (p. 213) | **Not acknowledged yet.** |
| **Beidleman’s Oxygen Flow (4L/min omitted, misleading readers about Mountain Madness oxygen strategy)** | *(Omitted from *Into Thin Air*.)* | **Not acknowledged yet (Journalistic Lapse).** |
| **Oxygen Disparity Between Expeditions (Did not mention Mountain Madness planned to provide more oxygen than Adventure Consultants)** | *(No mention in *Into Thin Air* of the different oxygen provisions between teams.)* | **Acknowledged and correction planned for future editions.** |
| **Makalu Gau’s Summit Time (Gau reported 3:00 PM, but Krakauer only reports 3:45 PM without telling the reader he rejected Gau’s time)** | *"Around this time two Sherpas on the Taiwanese team arrived, followed soon thereafter by Makalu Gau."* (p. 282) | **Acknowledged and disputed.** |
| **Charlotte Fox’s Statement Omitted (*American Alpine Journal*) (She stated she wanted to descend, but Beidleman kept group together)** | *(Omitted from *Into Thin Air*.)* | **Not acknowledged yet.** |
| **Planned Stunt on the Summit (Krakauer admitted a stunt was planned but claims it was irrelevant)** | *(Omitted from *Into Thin Air*.)* | **Acknowledged and disputed.** |
| **Mallory's Age (37, not 38)** | *"In 1924 Mallory was thirty-eight, a married schoolmaster with three young children."* (p. 15) | **Acknowledged and corrected.** |
| **Altered Quote – Turnaround Time (Removed “dictated by Rob”)** | *"Around 11:00, Hall told Hutchison and Taske that the top was still three hours away, and then he sprinted to try and get past the Taiwanese. 'It seemed increasingly unlikely that we would have any chance of summitting before the one P.M. turn-around time,' says Hutchison."* (p. 225)  **Original:** *"It seemed increasingly unlikely that we would have any chance of summiting before the 1 P.M. turn-around time dictated by Rob."* | **Not acknowledged yet.** |
| **Kasischke’s Turnaround Decision (Misrepresents sequence of events)** | *"A brief discussion ensued. Kasischke was initially reluctant to concede defeat, but Taske and Hutchison were persuasive. At 11:30, the three men turned their backs on the summit and headed down, and Hall sent Sherpas Kami and Lhakpa Chhiri down with them."* (pp. 225-226)  *Kasischke turned around after Taske and Hutchison based on his own decision, not due to persuasion.  Kasischke says Lhakpa delivered oxygen to South Summit and would not meet up with him until the Balcony (Kasischke p.197). * **No evidence Hall sent Sherpas down at that time; they were delivering oxygen to South Summit.** | **Not acknowledged yet.** |
| **In 2025, Krakauer admitted that Groom and Namba were not together when this incident allegedly took place.  Groom's account does not have them together.  This quote from Groom appears to be fabricated.  Krakauer provided a significant portion of the interview and it is not consistent with Krakuer's apparantly fabricated quote: "I was actually waiting for Martin to come up and over [the ridge] so I could guide him down. But when I found Beck there, I immediately turned my attention to him. I didn’t know Beck was there. He was covered in snow when I first saw him, camouflaged a bit. When I first saw him I took him to be one of the Fischer group. So I completely ignored him as I tried to find my camera case and my used [oxygen] cylinder on the crest of the ridge."** |As soon as Adams saw Groom and Namba above him, he realized his mistake and climbed slowly back toward the Balcony. “Martin was out of it by the time he got back up to Yasuko and me,” Groom recalls. “His oxygen mask was off and his face was encrusted in snow. He asked, ‘Which way to the tents?’” Groom pointed, and Adams immediately started down the correct side of the ridge, following the trail I’d blazed perhaps ten minutes earlier.| **Not acknowledged yet.** |
|**The 5PM time has been confirmed to be inaccurate by Krakauer**|Around 5:00 P.M., as Beidleman accompanied his clients down the ridge, Mike Groom and Yasuko Namba were arriving at the Balcony some 500 feet below them. From this promontory at 27,600 feet, the route veers sharply off the ridge to the south toward Camp Four. When Groom looked in the other direction, however—down the north side of the ridge—through the billowing snow and faltering light he noticed a lone climber badly off route: it was Martin Adams, who’d become disoriented in the storm and mistakenly started to descend the Kangshung Face into Tibet. (p.257).  In his 2025 account, Krakauer notes Groom received the radio call at 4:55 PM and had send Namba and Krakauer down together roughtly at 4:15. "A detailed Base Camp radio log indicates that during a subsequent radio call at 4:55, Groom finally had a clear transmission with Rob Hall, during which Groom was able to convey to Hall precisely where to find two full bottles of oxygen stashed on the South Summit. Upon hearing this, according to Groom, Rob sounded as though he was feeling less stressed, “and his immediate problem seemed to be solved…. If Rob knew where the cylinders were, I saw no sense in continuing up.” So at this point Groom immediately turned around and headed back down the mountain to catch up with Namba and me. " | **Not acknowledged yet.** |
|**Lopsang had summited earlier.  It is a different Sherpa in the photo**|Sandy Pittman appeared over the final rise about 2:10, slightly ahead of Charlotte Fox, Lopsang Jangbu, Tim Madsen, and Lene Gammelgaard.(p.248).| **Not acknowledged yet.** |
|**Omitting Adams from assisting with the ropes**|Growing alarmed at the crowd stacking up at the South Summit, Beidleman roused Harris and Boukreev and strongly suggested that the three guides install the ropes themselves; hearing this, I quickly volunteered to help. Beidleman pulled a 150-foot coil of rope from his pack, I grabbed another coil from Ang Dorje, and with Boukreev and Harris we got under way at noon to fix lines up the summit ridge. But by then another hour had already trickled away.(p.228).  And section: "At the top of the Step I shared my concern with Beidleman and asked whether he minded if I hurried ahead to the summit instead of pausing to help him string the last coil of rope along the ridge. “Go for it,” he graciously offered. “I’ll take care of the rope.”  Krakauer himself never fixed any rope -- he merely carried a length of rope and then handed it to Beidleman.  Martin Adams (a client) helped fix the ropes in that section, as is visible in the 1PM photo.| **Not acknowledged yet.** |
|**Wrong count for oxygenless summits**|"By 1996 some sixty men and women had reached the summit without it—five of whom didn’t make it back down alive." p. 194. Prior to 1996, the couunt is 57 people for a total of 72 ascents. It is written at a part of the book prior to the climb, so it would be odd to include people who had not summited yet in the count.   Including 1996, there would be 61.  This assumes Bradey is counted, as it reflected in the Himalyan Database.  If Krakauer was not crediting Bradey, he should have specifically said so.|**Not acknowledged yet.** |
|**No metrological study provided**|"From the beginning, Hall had planned that May 10 would be our summit day. “Of the four times I’ve summitted,” he explained, “twice it was on the tenth of May. As the Sherpas would put it, the tenth is an ‘auspicious’ date for me.” But there was also a more down-to-earth reason for selecting this date: the annual ebb and flow of the monsoon made it likely that the most favorable weather of the year would fall on or near May 10." (p.178). No studying saying that has ever been located and Krakauer does not provide even a hint at to where he got the information that "the annual ebb and flow of the monsoon made it likely that the most favorable weather of the year would fall on or near May 10." Weather forecasts at the time showed high winds, so it is not clear what Krakauer is even referring to.|**Not acknowledged yet.** |
| **Hall's "39 Summits" Claim Mirrors Promotional Puffery, Misleads Readers and Scholars** | *"Between 1990 and 1995, Hall was responsible for putting thirty-nine climbers on the summit of Everest."* (p. 38). This closely mirrors Adventure Consultants’ marketing material—“Thirty-nine people on top since 1990”—quoted directly in *Into Thin Air: The Illustrated Edition*. The figure includes multiple ascents by Hall (4), Ball (2), guides Viesturs and Cotter, and 13 Sherpa summits (12 excluding Lopsangs 1995 summit). It also includes six climbs in 1990, before Adventure Consultants was founded. The actual number of paying clients who summited with Hall between 1990 and 1995 is 14. By rephrasing a promotional talking point in neutral-sounding language, Krakauer gives it unwarranted authority. The result is so convincing that even scholars like Julie Rak repeat the claim inaccurately: “Thirty-nine of his clients summited” (*False Summit*, p. 197). | **Not acknowledged yet.** |
| **Wrong time at Balcony on descent** | *“Tim Madsen, descending with Beidleman’s group, happened to glance up from the Balcony around 5:20 and saw Fischer as he began the traverse.”* (*Into Thin Air*, p. 286). This timestamp conflicts with multiple firsthand accounts placing the group at the Balcony at 6:00 PM, not 5:20. Charlotte Fox explicitly noted changing her headlamp battery “at six p.m.—one hour until dark,” and Gammelgaard likewise wrote “It’s probably close to 6:00PM, we simply have to be off.” Transcript confirmation appears in *The Climb*, where Tim, Lene, and Klev all agree the descent began “about six o’clock.” | **Not acknowledged yet.** |
|**Wrong time seeing Scott**|"At 3:10 Friday afternoon Fischer still hadn’t arrived on top, says Beidleman, adding, “I decided it was time to get the hell out of there, even though Scott hadn’t showed up yet.” He gathered up Pittman, Gammelgaard, Fox, and Madsen and started leading them down the summit ridge. Twenty minutes later, just above the Hillary Step, they ran into Fischer." (p.253). This is impossible given then 3:20 photo where Fischer is already above Beidleman.  They would have seen Fischer less than 10 minutes down.|**Not acknowledged yet.** |
| **False Claim about Lopsang Turning Up Oxygen to 4L** | “Early in the morning, when he’d started short-roping Pittman, [Lopsang] also cranked her oxygen flow as high as it would go—four liter per minute.” (p. 213) <br> Krakauer was not present for this and did not ask Lopsang. Pittman later confirmed she did not run out of oxygen, contradicting this claim. | **Not acknowledged yet.** |
| **Fabricated Quote Attributed to Michael Groom** | “Martin was out of it by the time he got back up to Yasuko and me,” Groom recalls. “His oxygen mask was off and his face was encrusted in snow. He asked, ‘Which way to the tents?’” (p. 257) <br> Groom has stated Namba was not with him at the time. Krakauer’s quote appears to be a fabrication, inconsistent with Groom’s published account and his 2025 comments. | **Not acknowledged yet.** |
| **Speculative Claim on May 10 as Climatologically Best Day** | “The annual ebb and flow of the monsoon made it likely that the most favorable weather of the year would fall on or near May 10.” (p. 178) <br> Krakauer provides no evidence for this meteorological claim, which appears unsubstantiated and possibly invented. | **Not acknowledged yet.** |
| **Incorrect Number of Taiwanese Climbers (Krakauer inflates to 4 instead of 3)** | *“Leaving camp just after Fischer’s team, Makalu Gau started up with three Sherpas—contrary to Hall’s understanding that no Taiwanese would make a summit attempt the same day we did.”* (*Into Thin Air*, p. 206). <br> **Correct:** Gau left with **two Sherpas** (total of three climbers), confirmed in *The Climb* (pp. 133–134) and the Himalayan Database. | **Not acknowledged yet.** |
| **Incorrect Total Number of Climbers Departing South Col (33, not 34)** | *“All told, thirty-four climbers departed for the summit in the middle of that night. Although we left the Col as members of three distinct expeditions, our fates were already starting to intertwine—and they would become more and more tightly bound with every meter we ascended.”* (*Into Thin Air*, p. 206). <br> **Correct:** Because the Taiwanese team included only **3 climbers (Gau + 2 Sherpas)**, not 4 as Krakauer claims, the total number of climbers leaving the South Col was **33, not 34.** "Of the thirty-three climbers who ascended Mount Everest from its south side on May 10, 1996, only twenty-eight climbers returned." Boukreev, Anatoli; DeWalt, G. Weston. The Climb: Tragic Ambitions on Everest (p. 225). | **Not acknowledged yet.** |
| **Moon Phase Misreported (Half/Last-Quarter, not Gibbous)** | *“A gibbous moon rose above the shoulder of 27,824-foot Makalu …”* (*Into Thin Air*, p. 207). **Correct:** On **May 10, 1996** the Moon was at **Last/Third Quarter**, about **49% illuminated** (quarter occurred ~**05:04 UT**; ~45–50% illumination through the night). Charlotte Fox likewise wrote: *“…a calm, cold evening bathed in the surreal light of a **half moon**.”* | **Not acknowledged yet.** |
| **Frank Fischbeck’s Everest Attempts (5, not 4)** | *“Within three hours of leaving the Col, Frank decided that something about the day just didn’t feel right. Stepping out of the queue, he turned around and descended to the tents. His fourth attempt to climb Everest was over.”* (*Into Thin Air*, p. 206–207). <br> **Correct:** The Himalayan Database records this as Fischbeck’s **fifth attempt** on Everest, not his fourth. Krakauer undercounts Fischbeck’s history of Everest climbs, minimizing his long persistence and experience. | **Not acknowledged yet.** |
| **Omission of Martin Adams’ Prior Himalayan Experience (Journalistic Lapse)** | *“Martin Adams, a forty-six-year-old Texan who’d made a bundle selling bonds, climbed up to join us.”* (*Into Thin Air*, p. 232). <br> **Correct:** Krakauer presents Adams only as a wealthy amateur with no mountaineering background. In fact, Adams had previously joined an expedition to **Makalu**, climbing alongside Boukreev and Beidleman (though he did not summit). This omission strips Adams of context and unfairly reinforces Krakauer’s theme of inexperienced, wealthy clients overwhelming Everest. | **Not acknowledged yet.** |
| **Oxygen Bottle Weight Overstated (Actual 7.7 lbs, not 6.6 lbs empty / 7 lbs full as claimed)** | *“Upon setting out from Camp Four on May 10, each client carried two 6.6-pound oxygen bottles and would pick up a third bottle on the South Summit from a cache to be stocked by Sherpas.”* (*Into Thin Air*, p. 219). <br> **Correct:** Manufacturer specifications list the empty bottle at **2.4 kg (5.3 lbs)**, and filled with **1.1 kg (2.4 lbs)** of oxygen, for a total of **3.5 kg (7.7 lbs)**. Krakauer’s stated weight of 6.6 lbs underestimates the true load of each bottle. (p. 219). Same mistake made on p.196 | **Not acknowledged yet.** |
| **Incorrect Date of Kruse’s Collapse and Descent (Placed on April 27 instead of April 28)** | *“On April 26 he’d climbed from Camp Two to Camp Three, brewed some tea for himself and his teammates, and then lay down in his tent to take a nap. ‘I fell right asleep,’ Kruse recalls, ‘and ended up sleeping almost twenty-four hours, until about two P.M. the following day. When somebody finally woke me up it immediately became apparent to the others that my mind wasn’t working, although it wasn’t apparent to me. Scott told me, ‘We gotta get you down right away.’”* (*Into Thin Air*, p.173). <br> **Correct:** Both Boukreev (*The Climb*, pp. 101–103) and Gammelgaard (*Climbing High*, p. 128) place Kruse’s collapse and assisted descent on **April 28**, not April 27. Krakauer’s reliance on Kruse’s memory introduces a discrepancy in a critical medical episode. Both Gammelgaard and Boukreev have a significantly different version of the events, with neither remotely coming close to Kruse sleeping for 24 hours. | **Not acknowledged yet.** |
|**Incorrect number of years of Himalaya experience for Boukreev** | "Tall and blond, with handsome Slavic features, Boukreev was one of the most accomplished high-altitude climbers in the world, with twenty years of experience in the Himalaya, including two ascents of Everest without supplemental oxygen." (*Into Thin Air*, p.186). <br> **Correct:** Boukreev first climbed in the Himalaya in his 1989 ascent of Kangchenjunga which is well short of 20 years experience in the Himalaya.  At that time Boukreev had 20 years total mountaineering experience, but less than 7 in the Himalaya.| **Not acknowledged yet.** | 
|**Namba didn't grab the rope** | "Now, as Beidleman clung precariously to the rock 100 feet above the clients, the overly eager Yasuko clamped her jumar to the dangling rope before the guide had anchored his end of it. As she was about to put her full body weight on the rope—which would have pulled Beidleman off—Mike Groom intervened in the nick of time and gently scolded her for being so impatient."  (P.223). <br> This is contradicted by Michael Groom’s version and a photo taken shortly before Beidleman started fixing the ropes.  Groom states that Beidleman headed out with the rope, but Groom suddenly got stomach camps and doubled over and slumped down.  Beidleman had tossed him the rope to anchor in, but since Groom couldn’t pick it up, Ang Dorje did and Ang Dorje tied it into the anchor.  The photo show Namba is nowhere near the lead climbers just shortly prior to the alleged incident and it is took difficult to believe that Namba somehow stepped out of line and passed all those people just so she could accommodate Krakauer’s story. | **Not acknowledged yet.** |

### **Why the Journalistic Lapse About Groom’s Account of South Summit is Important**
- **Krakauer presents the delay at the South Summit as a result of missing fixed ropes**, reinforcing his argument that Lopsang short-roping Pittman contributed to the disaster. 
- **Groom’s account contradicts this, showing that the team was waiting on Hall’s explicit orders—not for ropes to be fixed.**
- **Charlotte Fox’s published account in *American Alpine Journal* further confirms that the Mountain Madness team was waiting for oxygen bottles, not due to missing ropes.**
- **Fox stated:**
  > "It turns out I had plenty of time to contemplate our next move. We waited again while more people arrived at our small sheltered nook under the South Summit. All were due for a last bottle of oxygen at this point (which we would use to summit and descend to the South Col) to be delivered by Sherpa staff. I recall some discussion there about the possibility of more rope to fix the narrow ridge and the Hillary Step. After waiting for more than an hour the oxygen bottles finally arrived and someone produced just enough rope for Anatoli to fix the Step; the ridge up to it had some old exposed lines that would have to suffice. One mis-step here and it was a one-way ticket into either Nepal or Tibet."
  
  **[Source: American Alpine Journal](https://publications.americanalpineclub.org/articles/12199702700/A-Time-To-Live-A-Time-To-Die-Tragedy-on-the-Southeast-Ridge-of-Mount-Everest)**

- **Boukreev’s account in *The Climb* further supports that Mountain Madness was waiting for their oxygen to arrive:**
  > "Adams followed, and as they resettled, according to Adams, Beidleman asked him, ‘How much oxygen do you have?’ Adams took off his pack, because his pressure gauge, like all the climbers’, was affixed to the top of his canister. ‘I read five pounds on my gauge,’ and then I asked him, ‘How much have you got?’ and he said, ‘Me, too, five pounds, but I got a full bottìe from Toli, too.’ Adams’s impatience with the progress of the climb began to chafe against his natural inclination to take action. He was not the type to sit around. Even in his mildly hypoxic state he understood clearly that he was sucking the last of his oxygen from his second canister. ‘So, I knew it would have been pushing my luck, but I said to Neal, “Let’s go! Give me the full bottle of oxygen and let’s go.” But, he said, “No, I’m not giving you this bottle.” So, I said, “Okay, I’ve got five pounds, give me your five and let’s get out of here.” And he agreed to that, but then we never went anywhere.’" (*The Climb*, pp. 143-144)
  
  > "More than an hour after he had reached the South Summit, Adams recognized the first of the Mountain Madness Sherpas to arrive and went to him to get his third and last bottle. Discarding his almost empty canister and the one Beidleman had given him, Adams screwed his hose onto the full one and began to breathe a little more easily." (*The Climb*, p. 144)

- **By ignoring both Groom and Fox’s statements, as well as Boukreev’s account, Krakauer distorts the sequence of events and unfairly links delays to Pittman instead of Rob Hall’s leadership decisions.**

This misrepresentation is significant because it **supports a false causal link between Pittman and the disaster**, when in reality, the team was waiting for Hall’s decision and the arrival of oxygen bottles, independent of any fixed rope issues.

### **Why Makalu Gau’s Summit Time is Important to the Oxygen Theft Issue**
- **Makalu Gau reported summiting at 3:00 PM, while Krakauer states he arrived at 3:45 PM.**
- **Gau was moving slowly all day**, yet between the **South Summit and the true summit, his pace dramatically increased—if he summited at 3:00 PM.**  
- If **Gau actually reached the summit at 3:00 PM**, it suggests he **obtained additional oxygen at the South Summit**, likely at least **two bottles.**  
- This raises **serious questions** about where those bottles came from—**whether they were his own or belonged to someone else.**  
- Given Krakauer’s **later acknowledgment of oxygen theft at the South Summit (which he omitted from *Into Thin Air*)**, this **adds another potential connection to the missing oxygen.**
- Krakauer's incorrect reporting of the number of Sherpa supporing Gau on the climb is also important.  With only two Sherpa supporing him, he would have that much less oxygen of his own than with the incorrectly reported three Sherpa supporting him. 

---
### **Why the Charlotte Fox Omission and Summit Stunt Matter**
- **Charlotte Fox stated she wanted to descend earlier, but Neal Beidleman kept the group together.**  
- This suggests **the group was told to wait at the summit longer than necessary**, possibly for a **photo or publicity event**.  
- Krakauer **acknowledges a stunt was planned** but claims **it was irrelevant**. However, **delaying descent** may have contributed to later problems on the mountain.  
- By **omitting Fox’s statement**, *Into Thin Air* makes the delay appear **natural**, when in reality, it **may have been a conscious decision that put climbers at greater risk**.

### **Why Doug Hansen’s Alleged Summit is Far More Unlikely than Likely**  
Whether Doug Hansen reached the summit of Everest on May 10, 1996 remains unconfirmed. Krakauer’s *Into Thin Air* reports Hansen’s summit as fact, but there is no direct evidence—no photographs, summit rocks, radio confirmation, or eyewitness testimony. Krakauer had already written his 1996 *Outside* article before conducting a formal interview with Lopsang, the only potential witness, and even in Lopsang’s later accounts he does not say he saw Hansen on the summit. Instead, he describes waiting at the point where he had fixed a rope with his ice axe—well below the top. Ang Dorje and Norbu’s accounts in *Storm Over Everest* further contradict Krakauer, placing Hall and Hansen much lower on the ridge.  

Photographs, timings, and Sherpa testimony all suggest Hansen was moving too slowly above the Hillary Step to realistically reach the summit and return by the time of Rob Hall’s 4:30 and 4:41 radio calls. The famous 3:20 Beidleman photo shows Hansen clipped into a fixed rope far below the summit, and his pace makes a summit highly unlikely. While it is possible Hall encouraged Hansen upward, the evidence supports that he stalled before the top. Krakauer’s choice to present Hansen’s summit as fact—without proof while ignoring or altering Sherpa statements about the events they personally witnessed—reflects a larger journalistic lapse.
