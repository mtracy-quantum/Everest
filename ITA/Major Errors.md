## Introduction

Krakauer made several major errors and ommissions in Into Thin Air. These include ignoring the clear evidence that Rob Hall told the team to wait at South Summit and that was the true reason for the delays, ignoring the initial oxygen bottle loading for the teams with Mountain Madness clients receiving significantly more oxygen than Adventure Consultants on the summit day, ignoring the very distinct possibility of oxygen bottle theft while blaming Andy Harris for saying there was a problem with the oxygen, chaning a key time he was at the base of the Hillary Step, blaming Sandy Pittman for delays in rope fixing, and inventing a fact to support his theory about the Montenegrins.  For some of these, such as inventing a fact about the Montenegrins, Krakauer has admitted he invent it.  For others, he partially admitds while continue to deflect.

Taken together, these issues demonstrate that Krakauer’s book was not merely a flawed personal account but a narrative deliberately crafted in ways that misrepresented key aspects of the disaster. Whether due to negligence, bias, or an intent to preserve a preferred version of events, Into Thin Air distorts critical elements of what happened on Everest in 1996. The following sections provide a detailed breakdown of these inaccuracies and their broader implications.

I will add sections on The fabrication of the variable turn around time and on the "stunt" in the near future.

## Delays Were from Rob Hall Instructing the Team to Wait

### Krakauer's Narrative
Krakauer asserts that significant delays in fixing the ropes contributed to the 1996 Everest disaster. His framing suggests that the absence of Sherpas fixing ropes early on caused dangerous bottlenecks. However, an in-depth analysis of the timeline shows that the delays were actually due to **Rob Hall instructing his team to wait at the South Summit**, not because of missing fixed lines.

### Evidence
Michael Groom states:
> "Rob, however, wanted us to regroup at the South Summit and assess the situation from there."

Groom explicitly confirms that Adventure Consultants did not proceed because Hall **ordered them to wait** at South Summit. This contradicts Krakauer’s suggestion that delays stemmed from rope-fixing issues or indecision among the climbers.

Additionally, Neal Beidleman’s firsthand account confirms that he and Ang Dorje were actively fixing ropes while others were still sitting at the Balcony, waiting for Hall’s permission to proceed. Beidleman and Boukreev only moved forward once Mountain Madness’s oxygen had arrived, not because of any confusion about rope fixing.

### Krakauer’s Omission
Krakauer omits the crucial detail that Ang Dorje and Lopsang actually left the Balcony ahead of him **to fix ropes**, but Lopsang soon became ill. Beidleman then took over rope-fixing duties, which meant that work on the ropes continued uninterrupted. Instead, Krakauer speculates on Ang Dorje’s mood and claims that nobody was fixing ropes, misrepresenting the situation.

Krakauer also omits Groom's account, which directly attributes the delays at the South Summit to Rob Hall’s instructions. Even in his recent corrections to *Into Thin Air*, Krakauer continues to blame the delays on fixed ropes, despite evidence to the contrary.

> The first client to go up the fixed ropes on the Southeast Ridge was Martin Adams, who waited more than 45 minutes at the base of the ropes before he could start ascending them. On the Hillary Step, after Boukreev fixed a rope to the top, I was the first client to ascend it. I waited from approximately 11:00 A.M., when I arrived on top of the South Summit, until approximately 12:30 P.M., when I started ascending the rope up the Step. If you subtract 20 minutes to account for the time I spent traversing the corniced ridge between the South Summit and the base of the Hillary Step, I was delayed approximately 70 minutes.

The 70-minute delay Krakauer claims was a critical factor had nothing to do with fixed ropes. It was because Rob Hall told them to wait at South Summit, and they followed his instructions.

### Analysis
The delays at South Summit had **nothing to do with rope fixing** and everything to do with Hall’s decision to pause the climb. Krakauer’s omission of this key fact leads to a misleading narrative that unfairly blames Sherpas and other climbers for delays when, in reality, the delay was pre-planned by Hall himself.

By excluding this critical piece of information, Krakauer perpetuates the false notion that disorganization and a lack of preparation caused the delays, when, in fact, the team was simply waiting for Hall’s go-ahead. This selective storytelling fundamentally alters the reader’s understanding of what actually went wrong on Everest in 1996.

## Page 220: The Montenegrins’ Fixed Lines

### Krakauer's Original Claim
> The Montenegrins, who’d gotten even higher [than Göran Kropp, the Swedish Soloist who ascended to within 350 feet of the top on May 3], had installed some fixed line [on May 9], but in their inexperience they’d used all they had in the first 1,400 feet above the South Col, wasting it on relatively gentle slopes where it wasn’t really needed.

### Krakauer's Correction
In a later reflection, Krakauer admitted:

> "I should not have written this. It was presumptuous of me to speculate they’d ‘wasted’ all of their fixed line by installing it well below the Southeast Ridge and Hillary Step. It’s likely they were still carrying enough rope to fix the Hillary Step when they turned around below it because of high wind. Furthermore, I was very grateful for the rope they’d fixed as I descended from the Balcony to the South Col into the rapidly intensifying storm on May 10, when I was exhausted and out of bottled oxygen."

### Analysis
Krakauer’s admission reveals that he fabricated a key fact—his claim that the Montenegrins had "used all their rope in the first 1,400 feet" without any supporting evidence. This is a direct violation of investigative journalism ethics, where factual accuracy is paramount. Rather than investigating whether they had additional rope, he speculated and presented it as fact, misleading readers.

Furthermore, his claim that the Montenegrins were "inexperienced" ignores the reality that it was actually the Sherpa on their team who fixed the ropes. This framing subtly shifts responsibility and reinforces a misleading narrative. Krakauer's pattern of inaccuracies—such as misreporting the time at the base of the Hillary Step, omitting the details of initial oxygen loading, and ignoring reports of stolen oxygen—suggests that these may not be mere "honest mistakes."

While he acknowledges his mistake and expresses gratitude for the correction, he simultaneously dismisses the person who pointed it out as a "troll" who is "misleading" people about his book. This contradiction raises further concerns about Krakauer’s reliability as an investigative journalist and whether these errors serve to craft a specific narrative rather than accurately report events.

## The Oxygen Distribution Issue

### Krauker acknoleges the issue

In a response video, Krakauer quotes me:
> "Previously I was critical of Jon Krakauer’s Into Thin Air because it failed to mention that the Mountain Madness clients received four oxygen bottles while the Adventure Consultants’ received only three for their summit bids."

And then notes:

> "This criticism is valid. In future editions of my book I will update what I wrote about the number of oxygen cannisters received by each team — although when I do, I will correct Tracy’s incorrect assertion that Scott Fischer’s clients each received four oxygen bottles, and that Rob Hall’s clients each received three bottles. At least one of Fischer’s clients, and possibly others, received more than four oxygen cannisters. And it’s possible at least one or two of Hall’s clients received more than three cannisters."

(Source: [Jon Krakauer on Medium](https://jonkrakauer.medium.com/the-youtuber-on-a-mission-to-trash-my-book-chapter-four-bc4d0204b0a0))

### Analysis
Krakauer acknowledges that *Into Thin Air* failed to account for key details regarding oxygen distribution. However, his response misrepresents my argument. I did not claim that each person definitively received the planned number of bottles—he highlighted that **this was the intended distribution** but that theft and mismanagement resulted in climbers not receiving their expected supply.

The Mountain Madness team’s oxygen distribution is well-documented, including how many Sherpas carried bottles, where they were deposited, and how they were used. This information comes from Sandy Pittman’s debriefing tapes, published in *The Climb.* In contrast, the Adventure Consultants’ oxygen logistics remain unclear. Even Krakauer and Groom’s own accounts contradict each other on how many Sherpas carried oxygen from the South Col.

Krakauer’s claim that some of Fischer’s clients received more than four bottles and that some of Hall’s clients may have received more than three does not refute my point; it further highlights the lack of clarity regarding Adventure Consultants’ oxygen caches. If Krakauer had conducted proper investigative journalism, he should have been able to present a definitive record of oxygen distribution for Hall’s team, as exists for Fischer’s team. Instead, he obfuscates the issue by making vague claims while failing to provide evidence.

The failure to document oxygen distribution for Adventure Consultants accurately is why Krakauer's analysis is incomplete and incorrect. His failure to acknowledge that the other journalist on the expedition, Sandy Pittman, did indeed document, record, and make publicly available all of this information for Mountain Madness tells us alot about Krakauer's baises in his reporting.

## Page 235: The Oxygen Bottle Theft Issue

### Krakauer's Original Claim
> "When we got there, an examination of the oxygen cache immediately revealed that there were at least six full bottles. Andy, however, refused to believe it. He kept insisting that they were all empty, and nothing Mike or I said could convince him otherwise. The only way to know how much gas is in a canister is to attach it to your regulator and read the gauge; presumably this is how Andy had checked the bottles at the South Summit."

### Krakauer's Public Lecture and Correction
In a 2016 public lecture, Krakauer stated:

> "I ran out of oxygen. Someone stole the third of my three oxygen bottles."

Later, Krakauer walked back this claim, stating:

> "I regret saying this. I have no evidence that anyone stole an oxygen cannister intended for me. Yes, the purportedly full cannister Michael Groom handed to me at the South Summit on May 10 was only half full. But I lack sufficient information to state with certainty that the cannister was depleted because someone from another team intentionally exchanged their half-empty cannister for one of Hall’s full cannisters earlier in the day."

### Analysis
The issue here is that Krakauer's original claim in *Into Thin Air*—that there were "at least six full bottles" at the South Summit—is incorrect. Andy Harris, whom Krakauer portrays as confused and hypoxic, was actually correct in stating that the bottles were not full. Krakauer, on the other hand, failed to verify the status of the bottles and instead dismissed Harris’s statements as irrational.

By asserting that "nobody, including Michael Tracy, knows exactly how many oxygen bottles were used," Krakauer deflects responsibility for the misinformation in his book. However, as an investigative journalist who interviewed dozens of climbers, he was in a position to verify these facts but failed to do so. In contrast, we have precise data for the Mountain Madness team’s oxygen logistics from Sandy Pittman’s debriefing tapes, published in *The Climb*. No similar record exists for Adventure Consultants, and even Krakauer and Groom’s accounts contradict each other regarding how many Sherpas carried oxygen from the South Col.

Ultimately, Krakauer’s error regarding the oxygen bottles at the South Summit misrepresented the situation and unfairly cast doubt on Harris’s credibility. His later backtracking on the theft accusation further erodes confidence in the reliability of his overall account. Instead of conducting a thorough investigation and providing a clear record of oxygen distribution, he relied on speculation and later dismissed scrutiny as unwarranted attacks.

## The Pittman Blame Issue

### Krakauer's Implied Attribution
Throughout *Into Thin Air* and his reporting, Krakauer repeatedly attributes key failures—particularly the failure to fix ropes in advance—to Lopsang Jangbu Sherpa being occupied with short-roping Sandy Pittman and carrying her satellite phone:

> "And now Lopsang had just towed Pittman on a short-rope for five or six hours above the South Col, substantially compounding his fatigue and preventing him from assuming his customary role in the lead, establishing the route. Because his unexpected absence from the head of the line had a bearing on the day’s outcome, his decision to short-rope Pittman provoked criticism and bafflement after the fact. ‘I have no idea why Lopsang was short-roping Sandy,’ says Beidleman. ‘He lost sight of what he was supposed to be doing up there, what the priorities were.’"
(*Into Thin Air*, p. 216)

> "This year, even though they were on different teams, Ang Dorje had again been asked to work with Lopsang on summit day—and again Lopsang appeared to be acting squirrelly. Ang Dorje had been working well beyond the call of duty for six long weeks. Now, apparently, he was tired of doing more than his share. Looking sullen, he sat beside me in the snow, awaiting the arrival of Lopsang, and the ropes were left unfixed. As a consequence, I ran smack into the first bottleneck ninety minutes after moving beyond the Balcony, at 28,000 feet, where the intermingled teams encountered a series of massive rock steps that required ropes for safe passage. Clients huddled restlessly at the base of the rock for nearly an hour while Beidleman—taking over the duties of an absent Lopsang—laboriously ran the rope out."
(*Into Thin Air*, p. 223)

> "For some reason, however, the Sherpas hadn't set out ahead of us on the night of May 9. When Ang Dorje and I reached the Balcony, we were an hour in front of the rest of the group, and we could have easily moved on and installed the ropes. But Hall had explicitly forbidden me to go ahead, and Lopsang was still far below, short-roping Pittman. There was nobody to accompany Ang Dorje."
(*Outside Magazine Article*)

Krakauer frames these events as major factors in the delays that led to disaster. However, evidence suggests his version of events exaggerates the duration of Pittman’s short-roping and the extent of its impact on the climb. Analysis of terrain and other accounts suggest Lopsang short-roped Pittman for a significantly shorter time than Krakauer claims.

Furthermore, Krakauer later introduces an additional claim that Lopsang turned Pittman’s oxygen flow to **4 liters per minute** early in the climb, causing her to run out of oxygen below the summit. This assertion lacks supporting evidence and contradicts standard oxygen consumption rates.

### Analysis
Krakauer’s portrayal of Pittman and Lopsang’s actions subtly shifts blame onto them for failures that had deeper structural causes. His repeated framing of these events as pivotal in the disaster aligns with his broader pattern of emphasizing certain factors while minimizing others, shaping a narrative that deflects from the broader mismanagement on Everest that season. Additionally, Krakauer’s repeated emphasis on Lopsang’s supposed failure to perform his duties due to Pittman’s presence lacks corroboration from other sources. Given that the Montenegrins had fixed ropes the day prior, the assertion that Lopsang’s absence solely caused the delay does not hold up under scrutiny.

## The "Third on the Descent" Policy

### Krakauer’s Account and Its Implications
Krakauer has since acknowledged that he and other climbers followed a flawed oxygen strategy on summit day, which required picking up a third oxygen bottle on the descent rather than on the ascent. This "Third on the Descent" plan created unnecessary risk by leaving climbers without oxygen at the most critical points of the climb. 

> "At 4:30 P.M., and again at 4:41, Hall got on the radio to say that he and Hansen were in trouble high on the summit ridge and urgently needed oxygen."
(*Into Thin Air*, p. 285)

This plan directly contributed to multiple climbers running out of oxygen above the Hillary Step, including Krakauer, Hall, and Harris. Mountain Madness, by contrast, did not use this approach—its climbers received their third bottles on the ascent, avoiding the risks faced by Adventure Consultants’ team.

### Analysis
The "Third on the Descent" plan was deeply flawed, and its failure was not an altitude-induced mistake but a premeditated decision made well in advance. It should have been apparent that this strategy introduced unnecessary risks, especially given the climbing speed of Hall’s team. The delays encountered on the climb meant that those following this plan were left without oxygen at critical points. 

Krakauer has accepted responsibility for following this plan, calling his actions "reckless, irresponsible, and incredibly stupid," but the decision to implement the plan ultimately rests with Rob Hall. Hall’s reliance on this system—despite the fact that none of his clients were fast enough to execute it safely—was a catastrophic miscalculation that contributed directly to the fatalities of 1996.

## The 1:00 PM at the base of the Hillary Step Time Error

### Krakauer's Original Claim
In *Into Thin Air*, Krakauer wrote:

> "But now it was already after 1:00…."

This statement suggests that he was at the base of the Hillary Step after 1:00 PM, yet he summited at 1:12 PM. This would mean he climbed from the base of the Hillary Step to the summit in only 12 minutes—an impossibly fast ascent, even for elite climbers.

### Krakauer’s Correction
In his later clarification, Krakauer claimed:

> "When I typed ‘1:00’ in the sentence above as I was writing the manuscript for my book, I had meant to type ‘12:00,’ which was the correct time, but I accidentally dropped the ‘2.’ This typo resulted in the time being erroneously published as ‘1:00.’"

### Analysis
Krakauer’s explanation does not hold up to scrutiny. If he had intended to write "12:00," then there should have been no reason for him to be “nervous” about seeing that time on his watch. He had already stated that he left the South Summit at noon—so what other time could he have expected? His reaction implies that he saw a time much later than expected, reinforcing the idea that he initially wrote "1:00 PM" because that’s what he intended to write because it fit his narrative.

By altering these timeline details, Krakauer presents a misleading narrative about the speed of his ascent and the causes of delays on summit day. Instead of acknowledging that delays stemmed from poor expedition planning and decisions like "Third on the Descent," he shifts the focus to vague or incorrect factors that obscure the true nature of what happened.
