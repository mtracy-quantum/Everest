Images related to AI processing of image analysis on Mt. Everest

All these pictures were taken by me with my own camera and are available to use under the Creative Commons.

I'll keep adding images that I feel are useful, but in general I just upload composites as individual pictures just look like a bunch of rocks.  Without being compositied together, it is very difficult to determine exactly what part of the mountain they are from.

If there is a particular item you want, just open up an issue and I'll see if I have that picture.  However, no pictures of discrebable bodies will be posted.
