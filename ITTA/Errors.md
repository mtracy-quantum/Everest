## Page 44: Frank Fischbeck's Everest Attempts

### Krakauer's Claim
> Frank Fischbeck, fifty-three, a dapper, genteel publisher from Hong Kong, had attempted Everest three times with one of Hall’s competitors;
> in 1994 he’d gotten all the way to the South Summit, just 330 vertical feet below the top.

### The Facts
According to **The Himalayan Database**, Fischbeck is recorded as having **four prior attempts** on Everest (not three):  
- **1992**: Attempt recorded.  
- **1993**: Attempt recorded.  
- **1994**: Highest point reached: below the South Summit.  
- **1995**: Highest point reached: Balcony.  

> Fischbeck ran out of oxygen below South Summit and turned back, so his pal Kerr (who had summited before) also turned back. Fischbeck moving fairly slowly and would have difficult to get him to summit. All slept at C4 again and on 14th to C2.
- Fischbeck's date of birth is reported as 1939 and he is reported as being 57 years old at the time of the 1996 attempt.  He was reported as 53 at the time of his first attempt in 1992.


### Discrepancy
- Krakauer's stated age for Fischbeck is wrong.
- Krakauer states Fischbeck had three prior attempts on Everest.
- The Himalayan Database contradicts this with four recorded prior attempts.
- Krakauer states that Fischbeck reached the South Summit (330 vertical feet below the summit) in 1994.
- The Himalayan Database contradicts this, recording Fischbeck’s highest point as **below the South Summit**, indicating he did not reach that landmark.

### Analysis

These errors likely arose from secondhand or misunderstood information. While the difference may appear minor, it alters the portrayal of Fischbeck’s climbing achievements, especially given the significance of reaching the South Summit.
Failure to investigate: Krakauer did not look into whether Fischbeck and been turned down by the team he had previously climbed with. Burleson and Athens were on Everest in 1996.

## Page 44: The Oldest Member

### Krakauer's Claim
> John Taske, at fifty-six the oldest member of our group, was an anesthesiologist from Brisbane who’d taken up climbing after retiring from the Australian army.

### The Facts
According to **The Himalayan Database**, Taske's birthyear is recored as 1940. 
According to Taske's CV, his birthday is May 7, 1940. (https://straskye.tripod.com/pages/documents/TaskeMilCV.pdf).  This made him 55 on March 31 -- the day in which Krakauer 
is describing the ages of the various climbers. The statement that Taske was 56 at that time is inaccurate. 

As noted above, Fischbeck is reported as the oldest member of the expedition.
